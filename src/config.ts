    en: "Drawing on the multicultural perspective I gained during my studies in Austria and my graduate work in informatics at the University of Tsukuba, I co-developed a hands-free audio guide using BLE technology in partnership with Shinshu University. The system allows visitors who are visually impaired to enjoy art independently. I also hold the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. In my free time I love watching films and listening to music.",
    ja: "私はオーストリア留学で培った多文化的視点と、筑波大学大学院で学んだ情報学を生かし、BLE 技術を用いたハンズフリー音声ガイドを開発しました（信州大学との共同研究）。これにより、視覚障がい者が自立してアートを鑑賞できる環境を実現しています。また、Google Data Analytics 認定を取得しています。趣味は映画鑑賞と音楽鑑賞です。"
